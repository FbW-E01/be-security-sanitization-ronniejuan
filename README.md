# Backend Security: add validation and sanitation

Examine at the provided API

- There are two endpoints
- There is one schema and model
- There is a frontend provided; open index.html with live server
- Edit index.html only if necessary

## Your tasks

Do these in order!

1. Setup the project
    - Make the mongoose connection work
    - Make sure the backend starts
    - Open the "frontend"
    - Both backend and frontend *should* work right away
2. Add validation and sanitation logic to the endpoint
    - Start very simple at first
        - At first just make it so that you are validating the "name" field (min length 3 characters)
    - Note that one of the fields is a telephone number
        - Think about and research telephone numbers
        - What kind of validation and sanitation would be good for this data?
3. Test
4. Briefly explain these files
    - package.json
    - .env.example
    - .gitignore
    - database.js
    - errorController.js
5. **BONUS** Make it so that the email is saved too!
